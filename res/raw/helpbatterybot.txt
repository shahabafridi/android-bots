Battery Bot is the battery manager of your device. You have 3 selections depending on the level of the battery. They are High, Medium and Low. You can manually set system settings for each of these battery levels. You can change Screen brightness, screen timeout in milliseconds, Turn on/off Wifi, Bluetooth or Data synchronization. Ex: If you want to turn Wifi off when battery is low just select Low and tick off the Wifi option. Battery Bot will automatically turns off Wifi if the battery discharges to a low level.
